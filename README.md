# [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) + Algolia

*Minima is a one-size-fits-all Jekyll theme for writers*. It's Jekyll's default (and first) theme.  

To add a new category and list of its posts, you need to creat a new html in /categories/[New category].html manually. -> This will be improved next time.

jekyll-algolia is included in this project for search, so that your updates like adding new post are reflected only when you apply your updates to algolia.
