# Customised [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)

*Minima is a one-size-fits-all Jekyll theme for writers*. It's Jekyll's default (and first) theme.  

## 1. Added features
### 1.1 Category

To add a new category and list of its posts, you need to creat a new html in /categories/[New category].html manually. -> This will be improved next time.

### 1.2 Alolia

jekyll-algolia is included in this project for search, so that **your updates like adding new post are reflected only when you apply your updates to algolia**.

~~### 1.3 Pagination 
Currently, it is not available.~~  

### 1.4 Centering images in post 
This is from [this post](https://thornelabs.net/posts/centering-images-with-jekyll-and-markdown.html) and my iternal CSS is defined on default.html

### 1.5 PDF embedding
