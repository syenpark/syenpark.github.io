# [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) + Algolia

*Minima is a one-size-fits-all Jekyll theme for writers*. It's Jekyll's default (and first) theme.  

To add a new category and list of its posts, you need to creat a new html in /categories/[New category].html manually. -> This will be improved next time.

jekyll-algolia is included in this project for search, so that your updates like adding new post are reflected only when you apply your updates to algolia.

Pagination is not available.  

PDF embedding is from [this post](https://jamesonzimmer.com/simple-pdf-embed-for-jekyll/)

Centering images in post is from [this post](https://thornelabs.net/posts/centering-images-with-jekyll-and-markdown.html) and my iternal CSS is defined on default.html
