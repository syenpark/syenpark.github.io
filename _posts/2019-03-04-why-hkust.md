1. Why did you choose HKUST / What do you like about this University?
A professor in my undergraduate recommended this school to me and another professor here introduced this program to me. I love here in that I can be exposed to a more multicultural environment and work with world class professors and classmates.  

2. What is so special about your program?
This program would be the best way to build solid knowledge in machine learning and data science technology within such a short period no matter you will go for research or industrial career. As their courses are a really heavy workload and well designed with covering various trendy technologies, we learn a lot for both aspects.

3. How did you benefit from the student diversity / any concerns before you came to HK e.g. adaptation / cuisine / safety but not an issue anymore?
It makes my communication skills better. I have been communicating with my classmates from many different background here including France, Spain, Kazakhstan, India, USA, mainland China, and Hong Kong. I become more flexible and make less ignorant judgments. 

I was little worried as I don’t know Chinese but it’s not an issue here.

4. How does the program help your career development?
This program makes me realise what I really want to do in AI and big data era. Although all people know AI and big data technology are promising skills in future, they are pretty vague and daunting to newcomers. Here I have communicated and worked with my brilliant classmates who have their own talents and visions and world class professors who can guide me. Now I realise I want to work on new job position in future to do big data resource management.

5. Anything you would like to share with future candidates about the university life 
(exposure / student activities / competitions)?
There are many free activities for student in Hong Kong arranged by high tech companies, institutes, HKUST and ourselves such as AI-training, hackathon, and social activities. It is not only the university life to take lesson in class and to do homework. With many activities here, you will meet many smart people everywhere who inspire you a lot.
