I majored in computer science (CS), albeit a different name, and want to do double check my knowledge to pursue further studies in CS. [Q4 of FAQs for New Postgraduate Students in CSE HKUST](https://www.cse.ust.hk/pg/newStudents/#preparation) states requirements for any postgraduate students in CS.

#### __Operating Systems__
[C (learn-c.org)](http://www.learn-c.org/) on Linux is required to deal with [Introduction to Operating Systems (Udacity)](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-operating-systems--ud923). Here is my GitHub repository: [Intro2OS](https://github.com/syenpark/Intro2OS)

#### __Design and Analysis of Algorithms__
[Introduction to Algorithms (MIT)](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.006/fall11/notes.shtml)

#### __Theory of Computation__
[Automata, Computability, and Complexity (MIT OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-045j-automata-computability-and-complexity-spring-2011/) and [Theory of Computation (MIT OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-404j-theory-of-computation-fall-2006/)
