I majored in computer science (CS), albeit a different name, and want to do review my knowledge to pursue further studies in CS. [Q4 of FAQs for New Postgraduate Students in CSE HKUST](https://www.cse.ust.hk/pg/newStudents/#preparation) states core requirements for any postgraduate students in CS, and I would like to share MOOCs related with these topics and their solutions by me.

### __Operating Systems__
- #### Introduction to Operating Systems (Udacity)
    This requires students with C knowledge. Should you want to see C first, check this page: [Practical Programming in C (MIT OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-087-practical-programming-in-c-january-iap-2010/)

    *My repo: [Intro2OS](https://github.com/syenpark/Intro2OS)*

### __Design and Analysis of Algorithms__
- #### Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python(edX)
    This course deals with python basics and rudimentary algorithms like sorting. 

    *My repo: [Intro2CSandPy](https://github.com/syenpark/Intro2CSandPy)*
- #### Introduction to Algorithms (MIT)
    [Intro2Algorithms](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.006/fall11/notes.shtml)

### __Theory of Computation__
- #### [Automata, Computability, and Complexity (MIT OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-045j-automata-computability-and-complexity-spring-2011/) 

- #### [Theory of Computation (MIT OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-404j-theory-of-computation-fall-2006/)

### __Others__
- #### Introduction to C++
    [Intro2Cpp](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-c-0)
- #### Intermediate C++
    [InterCpp](https://www.edx.org/course/intermediate-c-0)

Please feel free to share your any thoughts about my solusions and be willing to help me to improve them.
