I majored in computer science (CS), albeit a different name, and want to do review my knowledge to pursue further studies in CS. [Q4 of FAQs for New Postgraduate Students in CSE HKUST](https://www.cse.ust.hk/pg/newStudents/#preparation) states core requirements for any postgraduate students in CS, and I would like to share MOOCs related with these topics and their solutions by me.

### __Operating Systems__
- #### [Introduction to Operating Systems (Udacity)](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-operating-systems--ud923) 
    This requires students with C knowledge. 

    Here is my GitHub repository: [Intro2OS](https://github.com/syenpark/Intro2OS)

### __Design and Analysis of Algorithms__
- #### [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python(edX)](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2017_2/course/)
    Blow topics are interesting ones in the lecture.
    Problem Set 01: Problem 03 - Longest substring in alphabetical order
    Bisection Search VS. Binary Search

    Here is my GitHub repository: [Intro2CSandPy](https://github.com/syenpark/Intro2CSandPy)
- #### [Introduction to Algorithms (MIT)](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.006/fall11/notes.shtml).

### __Theory of Computation__
- #### [Automata, Computability, and Complexity (MIT OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-045j-automata-computability-and-complexity-spring-2011/) 

- #### [Theory of Computation (MIT OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-404j-theory-of-computation-fall-2006/)


Please feel free to share your any thoughts about my solusions and be willing to help me to improve them.
