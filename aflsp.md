[Asian Future Leaders Scholarship Program (AFLSP)](https://pg.ust.hk/aflsp) supported by [Bai Xian Asia Institute](https://www.bxai.org/) is definitely one of the most beneficial scholarship programs. I finally won this postgraduate scholarship at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) and want to inform prospective postgraduate students about the benefit of this program.

#### __A Full Scholarship__ 
AFLSP at HKUST provides a full scholarship to cover full tuition and living expenses for Asian students to pursue full time postgraduate studies even including taught postgraduate programs!

#### __Fruitful Activities by HKUST for AFLSP Scholars__
Activities such as leadership training, clutural exploration offered by HKUST.

#### __A 3-Week BXAI Summer Program__
It is mandatory to participate in [The BXAI Summer Program](https://www.bxai.org/aflsp/education-program/bxai-summer-program/overview/) fully supported by BXAI.  

#### __Lasting Relationships with Asian Future Leaders__


For these resons, I highly recommend AFLSP to the young from Asia. Do not hesitate to apply for postgraduate studies and AFLSP in HKUST!
