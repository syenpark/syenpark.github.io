[Asian Future Leaders Scholarship Program (AFLSP)](https://pg.ust.hk/aflsp) supported by [Bai Xian Asia Institute (BXAI)](https://www.bxai.org/) is definitely one of the most beneficial scholarship programs in the world. I ended up being one of AFLSP scholars at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) and want to inform prospective postgraduate students about the benefit of this program.

#### __A Full Scholarship__ 
AFLSP at HKUST provides a full scholarship to cover full tuition and living expenses for Asian students to pursue full time postgraduate studies like PhD, MPhil, MSc and MA.

#### __Fruitful Activities by HKUST for AFLSP Scholars__
Activities such as leadership training, clutural exploration offered by HKUST.

#### __A 3-Week BXAI Summer Program__
It is mandatory to participate in [The BXAI Summer Program](https://www.bxai.org/aflsp/education-program/bxai-summer-program/overview/) fully supported by BXAI.  

#### __Lasting Relationships with Asian Future Leaders__


Seeing me posting my portrait on the Internet, my father worring about my privacy tried to stop me. Specifically, he worried someone could appropriate my face somewhere. I defended myself against his concern by saying this; I will be pretty famous in the future and end up in public, so that I should not be afraid of that. Of course, this excuse satisfied my father very much, and he never ask me to stop posting my portrait again. I am very delighted to make my excuse true. I highly recommend AFLSP to the young from Asia. Do not hesitate to apply for postgraduate studies and AFLSP in HKUST!
