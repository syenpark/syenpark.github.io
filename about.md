### __AFLSP Scholar__
[Asian Future Leaders Scholarship Program (AFLSP)](https://pg.ust.hk/aflsp) supported by [Bai Xian Asia Institute (BXAI)](https://www.bxai.org/) is definitely one of the most beneficial scholarship programs in the world. I ended up being one of AFLSP scholars at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) and want to inform prospective postgraduate students about the benefit of this program.

- #### A full scholarship
    AFLSP at HKUST provides a full scholarship to cover full tuition and living expenses for Asian students to pursue full time postgraduate studies like PhD, MPhil, MSc and MA.

- #### Enrichment Programs by HKUST for AFLSP Scholars
    Activities such as leadership training, clutural exploration offered by HKUST.

- #### A 3-Week BXAI summer program
    It is mandatory to participate in [The BXAI Summer Program](https://www.bxai.org/aflsp/education-program/bxai-summer-program/overview/) fully supported by BXAI.

- #### Lasting relationships with Asian future leaders

Seeing me posting my portrait on the Internet, my father worring about my privacy tried to stop me. Specifically, he worried someone could appropriate my face somewhere. I defended myself against his concern by saying this; I will be pretty famous in the future and end up in public, so that I should not be afraid of that. Of course, this excuse satisfied my father very much, and he never asks me to stop posting my portrait again. I am very delighted to make my excuse true. I highly recommend AFLSP to the young from Asia. Do not hesitate to apply for postgraduate studies and AFLSP in HKUST.
